# Bank Churn Customer Analysis and Customer Segmentation
## Overview :
## 📊 Exploring Bank Customer Behavior:

**Ever wondered why customers leave a bank or how financial institutions can better serve their clients? 
This project dives into two critical aspects of banking analytics :**

## 🔍 Bank Churn Analysis :
We investigate the key factors behind customer churn and develop predictive models to help banks retain their clients.

## 📊 Customer Segmentation : 
By analyzing customer demographics, account details, and behavioral patterns, we categorize customers into meaningful segments. This helps banks tailor their products and services to meet specific customer needs.

## 🚀 Project Workflow : 
1. **Data Collection & Cleaning** – Clean and prepare bank customer data for analysis, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Identify trends and key insights.
3. **Modeling & Prediction** – Build predictive models(e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to predict analyze churn and evaluate 
     model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
4. **Churn Analysis** – Analyze factors contributing to customer churn using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and statistical techniques.
5. **Customer Segmentation** – Apply clustering techniques(e.g., K-Means) to group customers.
6. **Insights & Recommendations** – Provide actionable strategies for customer retention and engagement.

# 🚀 Project Objectives  :
## 1️⃣ Bank Churn Analysis  
- 🔍 **Data Exploration:** Identify key patterns in customer churn by analyzing account activity, transaction history, and demographics.  
- 🛠 **Preprocessing & Feature Engineering:** Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies to ensure high-quality data for modeling.  
- 🤖 **Predictive Modeling:** Build and evaluate machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest) for accurate churn prediction.  
- 📊 **Strategic Insights:** Provide actionable recommendations, such as personalized retention campaigns, improved customer support, and targeted offers.  

## 2️⃣ Customer Segmentation  
- 🏗 **Data Preparation:** Standardize, scale, and encode features for effective clustering.  
- 📌 **Clustering Techniques:** Apply K-Means to segment customers based on behavioral and demographic attributes.  
- 🔎 **Segment Analysis:** Identify distinct customer profiles to understand preferences and spending behavior.  
- 🎯 **Personalized Strategies:** Optimize marketing, services, and engagement tactics tailored to each segment to boost satisfaction and retention.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used : 
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Google Colab
- Machine Learning Models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest,K-Means Clustering etc.)

### Basic Sample:
![Exited Trend](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-username/your-repository/main/churn_rate.png)

### 📉 **Exited (Churn Rate Trend)**  
**Description:**  
- A declining trend from **0.8 to 0.0**, labeled as **"Exited."**  

**Insight:**  
- Represents the **churn rate** or percentage of customers leaving over time.  

**🔍 Actionable Insights:**  
✅ Investigate key reasons for churn (e.g., poor service, lack of engagement).  
✅ Implement retention strategies like personalized offers or loyalty programs to reduce churn.  

![Geography Analysis](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-username/your-repository/main/geography_chart.png)

### 🌍 **Geography-Based Analysis**  
**Description:**  
- A bar chart comparing values for **France, Spain, and Germany**, ranging from **0.00 to 0.35**.  

**Insights:**  
- **France**: Highest value (~0.35).  
- **Spain**: Moderate (~0.20).  
- **Germany**: Lowest (~0.10).  

**🔍 Actionable Insights:**  
✅ Focus on **reducing churn or improving satisfaction** in France.  
✅ Identify and **replicate successful strategies from Germany** in other regions.
