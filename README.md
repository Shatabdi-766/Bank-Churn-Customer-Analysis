# Bank Churn Customer Analysis and Customer Segmentation
## Overview :
## 📊 Exploring Bank Customer Behavior:

**Ever wondered why customers leave a bank or how financial institutions can better serve their clients? 
This project dives into two critical aspects of banking analytics :**

## 🔍 Bank Churn Analysis :
We investigate the key factors behind customer churn and develop predictive models to help banks retain their clients.

## 📊 Customer Segmentation : 
By analyzing customer demographics, account details, and behavioral patterns, we categorize customers into meaningful segments. This helps banks tailor their products and services to meet specific customer needs.

## 🚀 Project Workflow : 
1. **Data Collection & Cleaning** – Clean and prepare bank customer data for analysis, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Identify trends and key insights.
3. **Modeling & Prediction** – Build predictive models(e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to predict analyze churn and evaluate 
     model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
4. **Churn Analysis** – Analyze factors contributing to customer churn using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and statistical techniques.
5. **Customer Segmentation** – Apply clustering techniques(e.g., K-Means) to group customers.
6. **Insights & Recommendations** – Provide actionable strategies for customer retention and engagement.

# 🚀 Project Objectives  :
## 1️⃣ Bank Churn Analysis

### Basic Sample:
![Exited Trend](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Shatabdi-766/Bank-Churn-Customer-Analysis/main/images/download%20(11).png)

### 📉 **Exited (Churn Rate Trend)**  
**Description:**  
- A declining trend from **0.8 to 0.0**, labeled as **"Exited."**  

**Insight:**  
- Represents the **churn rate** or percentage of customers leaving over time.  

**🔍 Actionable Insights:**  
✅ Investigate key reasons for churn (e.g., poor service, lack of engagement).  
✅ Implement retention strategies like personalized offers or loyalty programs to reduce churn.
