# Bank Churn Customer Analysis and Customer Segmentation
## Overview :
# 📊 Exploring Bank Customer Behavior: A Data-Driven Approach

**Ever wondered why customers leave a bank or how financial institutions can better serve their clients? 
This project dives into two critical aspects of banking analytics :**

## 🔍 Bank Churn Analysis :
We investigate the key factors behind customer churn and develop predictive models to help banks retain their clients.

## 📊 Customer Segmentation : 
By analyzing customer demographics, account details, and behavioral patterns, we categorize customers into meaningful segments. This helps banks tailor their products and services to meet specific customer needs.

## 🚀 Project Workflow : 
1. **Data Collection & Cleaning** – Clean and prepare bank customer data for analysis, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Identify trends and key insights.
3. **Modeling & Prediction** – Build predictive models(e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to predict analyze churn and evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, 
   precision, recall, and F1-score.
4. **Churn Analysis** – Analyze factors contributing to customer churn using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and statistical techniques.
5. **Customer Segmentation** – Apply clustering techniques(e.g., K-Means) to group customers.
6. **Insights & Recommendations** – Provide actionable strategies for customer retention and engagement.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used : 
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Google Colab
- Machine Learning Models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest,K-Means Clustering etc.)
